      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective date: January 1, 2025</p>
      <p>
        Coral Hosts respects your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we handle it. We keep this document short on purposeâ€”fewer surprises and easier audits.
      </p>
      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Contact details that you submit via forms, live chat, or email.</li>
        <li>Operational metadata required to deliver managed hosting services (IP addresses, request logs, uptime metrics).</li>
        <li>Anonymous analytics on our marketing site to understand aggregate engagement. We do not use third-party ad trackers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How we use information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Respond to inquiries and provide proposals.</li>
        <li>Deliver managed hosting, support SLAs, and maintain security controls.</li>
        <li>Send operational updates, maintenance notices, and opt-in newsletters.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What we do not do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Sell or rent personal data.</li>
        <li>Share customer data outside of vetted sub-processors required to deliver the service.</li>
        <li>Track visitors for advertising networks.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Contact inquiries are retained for 24 months. Operational logs follow the retention policy defined in your service agreement (default: 35 days for request logs, 12 months for security events).
      </p>
      <h2>Sub-processors</h2>
      <p>
        We rely on trusted providers for infrastructure and operations: Cloudflare, Fly.io, AWS, Google Workspace, Atlassian, PagerDuty, and Linear. Sub-processor agreements include confidentiality and security requirements consistent with ours.
      </p>
      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        Email <a href="mailto:privacy@coralhosts.com">privacy@coralhosts.com</a> to access, correct, or delete your information. We respond within 30 days. Customers can also request SOC 2 reports or security questionnaires via their account manager.
      </p>
      <h2>Updates</h2>
      <p>
        We will post updates to this policy on this page and notify active customers 30 days before material changes.
