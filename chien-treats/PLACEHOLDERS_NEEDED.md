# Placeholders Needed for Production

## Status: Implementations Complete ‚úÖ

I've implemented all features that don't require external assets or business information. The site is now production-ready **except** for the following placeholder items that require your input.

## üî¥ CRITICAL - Required Before Launch

- **Style requirements:**
  - White or light cream background
  - Consistent lighting
  - Sharp focus on the macarons
  - Show texture and color accurately

**Products needing photos:**
1. Honey Lavender (purple/lavender color)
2. Strawberry Milk (pink color)
3. Chocolate Ganache (brown color)
4. Matcha Vanilla (green color)
5. Salted Caramel (golden brown color)

### 3. Favicon (Currently Good!)

---

## üü° HIGH PRIORITY - Verify/Update Before Launch

### 4. Business Information (Verify Accuracy)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Using example data - MUST UPDATE

**Currently configured values:**
```javascript
Business Name: "Chien's Treats"

Email: hello@chiens.treats
Domain: https://chiens-treats.example  // ‚ö†Ô∏è PLACEHOLDER
```

**What to update:**
1. **Confirm real business name** (Is "Chien's Treats" correct?)
2. **Confirm real address** (Is 714 E Pine St correct?)
3. **Provide real phone number** (555-0184 is a fake number)
4. **Provide real email** (Is hello@chiens.treats correct?)
5. **Provide real domain** (e.g., chienstreamats.com)

**Files to update:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (LocalBusiness schema)

```

**Questions to answer:**

**Where to update:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (LocalBusiness schema)

---

### 6. About Page Content
